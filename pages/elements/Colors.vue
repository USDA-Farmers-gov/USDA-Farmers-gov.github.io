    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <div>
      Colors play a vital role in establishing the look and feel of any digital property. Our palette draws inspiration from the USDA branding combined with color recommendations from the U.S. Web Design System to create a unique style for Farmers.gov.

    <div>
      Weâ€™ve added brighter, vibrant colors to symbolize the field greens and
      sky blues farmers often experience in their everyday lives. The intent of
      these colors is to establish a trusted and familiar foundation to the
      Farmer.gov experience.

    <h2>Primary Colors</h2>
    <div>
      The primary colors of the site, green and blue, signify the land and sky of America's beautiful landscapes. The vibrant chroma of the greens and blue establish a calm and positive energy that correlates with the sites photographic elements. The deep Asphalt adds dimension to the text and icon elements that would otherswise be lifeless if flat black.
