    <p class="intro-text text-margin-bottom">
      Icons show a behavior, support an action, and illustrate content. 
    </p>

    <h3>Interactive Icons</h3>
    <p>
      Interactive icons are functional icons that convey element behavior. Most interactive icons are modeled after USWDS's icon styles. They should be exported as a .svg file for higher resolution with a smaller file size.
    </p>

    <Table :data="interactive_icons" classes="text-margin-bottom" />

    <h3>Click Target</h3>
    <p>
      Interactive icons should have a minimum click/touch target of 44x44px. When used with a label, the icon and label should be one target. 
    </p>

    <div class="icons-click-target-grid text-margin-bottom">
      <img src="/images/icons/close.svg" class="highlight-overlay" />

      <div class="click-target-top-span span-blue span-blue-vertical"></div>
      <div class="click-target-top-dimension dimension-blue dimension-blue-vertical">44px</div>

      <div class="click-target-right-span span-red span-red-horizontal"></div>
      <div class="click-target-right-dimension dimension-red dimension-red-horizontal">44px</div>
      <div class="icons-click-target mouse-pointer"></div>
    </div>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Interactive icons need descriptive alternative text. They should meet 3:1 color contrast ratio requirements.

    </p>

    <h3>Supporting Icons</h3>
    <p class="text-margin-bottom">
      Supporting icons are non-interactive icons that are used as a visual cue for an action or an important message. They are used in context with text. 
    </p>

    <h4>Specs</h4>
    <p>
      Supporting icons are solid filled icons. They are simple geometric shapes that are easily recognizable. They should be exported as a .svg file for higher resolution with a smaller file size.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    
    <div class="row">
      <div v-for="icon in supporting_icons" class="medium-1" v-html="icon" />
    </div>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Supporting icons are used as decorative elements that don’t provide additional information.  Therefore, their alternative text should be empty (alt=“”) so that they can be skipped over when users utilize assistive technology such as screen readers.

    </p>

    <h3>Illustrative Icons</h3>
    <p>
      Illustrative icons are decorative icons that are used to visually represent the content. They add visual interest to the page and give a preview of the content when used on text heavy pages. Illustrative icons should not have any actions associated with them as they are used purely for decorative purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Specs</h3>
    <p>
      Illustrative icons have an outlined icon style. Outlined icons have a lighter line weight compared to solid icons, so they don’t overwhelm the associating content. They should use a consistent stroke weight. They should be exported as a .svg file for higher resolution with a smaller file size.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Examples</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="row text-margin-bottom">
      <div v-for="icon in illustrative_icons" class="medium-1" v-html="icon" />
    </div>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Illustrative icons are used as a decorative elements that don’t provide informative content.  Therefore, their alternative text should be empty (alt=“”) so that they can be skipped over when users utilize assistive technology such as screen readers.
