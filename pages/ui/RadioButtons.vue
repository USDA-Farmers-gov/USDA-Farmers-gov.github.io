    <h3>Form Radio Buttons</h3>

    <p>
      This style of radio buttons is commonly used in forms. All available options are visible. Users can only make a single selection. If users can make more than one selection, use checkboxes. Radio button icons and their labels should be left-aligned and vertical for better scannability when appropriate.
